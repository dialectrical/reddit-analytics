# Reddit analytics

A SPA made with React for viewing a heatmap of posts submitted to a given subreddit along with a list of posts made each hour. This uses [pushshift's api](https://github.com/pushshift/api) to gather data from Reddit and currently takes about 3 to 5 mintues to complete a request in order to reliably avoid exceeding the API's rate limit.

Check out the [demo](https://dialectrical.github.io/reddit-analytics/).
